- I am taking STATS 220 because it's apart of my course reuqirments but also it will be important to anazlyize and collect data
- I am interested in learning about how data is collected and stored and then using the data to from conclusions that can be used help or benift people. An exmaple of this is leanring what cause speople to commit more crimes comapred to others
