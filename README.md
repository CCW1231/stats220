# Stats220

This is my repo for **STATS 220**. 

## A little about me:

1. I am undertaking a degree in **data science** 
- I am taking **STATS 220** because it's apart of my course reuqirments, but because it will also be important to anazlyize and collect data
  2.  I am interested in learning about how data is collected and stored, and then using the data to form conclusions that can help or benefit people.
  -  An example of this is learning what factors contribute to people committing crimes and what can be done to reduce crime
