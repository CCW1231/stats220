# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in data science
- I am taking STATS 220 because it's apart of my course reuqirments, but because it will also be important to anazlyize and collect data
- I am interested in learning about how data is collected and stored, and then using the data to form conclusions that can help or benefit people. An example of this is learning what factors contribute to criminal behavior and what can be done to reduce crime

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://github.com/CCW1231/stats220/blob/main/cat.gif)
